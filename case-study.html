            <h1>Interactive App Design 1</h1>
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>
                For this course, we were challenged to identify and create an enjoyable digital microinteraction. 
                Over the past 10 weeks, we have identified a base interaction on which we would incrementally improve upon. Each week, we have 
                planned and integrated new meaningful microinteractions into one complete “micro” experience. This was an individual project so 
                all microinteractions were planned and coded individually (I used HTML, CSS, and Javascript). The purpose of this project was to 
                be able to identify what constitutes a meaningful interaction that would improve the user experience of the overall interaction. 

            </p>
            <h2>Context & Challenge</h2>
            <p>
                My base interaction was an accordion-style image gallery. This gallery is split into four vertical slices, with each image expanding 
                when hovered over. I found this base interaction to be interesting but felt that I could add additional microinteractions that would 
                better the experience of using this gallery. My goal was to see if I could improve the experience of using the gallery without replacing 
                any of its original functionality.
            </p>
            <h2>Process & Insight</h2>
            <p>
                The process of completing this project was done in three separate builds. There was an alpha, beta, and final build. The alpha phase 
                consisted of establishing the foundation of the interaction on which improvements would be made. For the alpha, I found a working sample 
                of code for the accordion image gallery that I had envisioned. After analyzing this code, I began working on what the design for my version
                of this project would look like. 
            </p>
            <h2>Solution</h2>
                <p>
                    Only minor changes were made to the interaction for the final design. I decided to add location-relevant sound effects when the user clicks on each
                    image. I felt that this could add an element of joy to the interaction. I also added links to travel websites when the user clicks on the title of 
                    each location. Redirecting to relevant information gives the interaction a functional end goal where users can learn more about each location.
                </p>

            <h2>Results</h2>
                <p>
                    I was very satisfied with the final build of this project. I set out to improve the base interaction with additional meaningful microinteractions, 
                    and I feel that this was achieved. I learned a lot during the process of completing this project. Breaking the project into three separate phases was 
                    an interesting process, as it challenged us to always be thinking ahead. I was always thinking about where the design and code would go next, and how 
                    to execute this plan. I also felt that this timeline made it so you had plenty of time to polish each design and build, which led to a better end result 
                    as well. I had only worked with microinteractions on a surface level before, so this course made me much more aware of the role that they play in user 
                    experience and how good microinteractions can elevate an experience to the next level.
